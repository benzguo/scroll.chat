          >, I suggested that some very stable and reliable media, DNA and print, owe their
          stability and reliability to <b>replication and retention</b> -- every reader gets a copy,
          and every reader keeps their copy. The web, on the other hand, follows the strategy used
          for books before the printing press -- put a single copy in an institution, allow readers
          to come visit, hope it doesn&apos;t go up in smoke.

          Whenever the ephemerality of the web is mentioned, two opposing responses tend to surface.
          Some people see the web as a <i>conversational</i> medium, and consider ephemerality to be
          a virtue. And some people see the web as a <i>publication</i> medium, and want to build a
          &quot;permanent web&quot; where nothing can ever disappear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Neither position is mine. If anything, I see the web as a <i>bad</i> medium, at least
          partly because it invites exactly that conflict, with disastrous effects on both sides.

          For the law and for the courts, link rot and content drift, which are collectively known
          as &#x201C;reference rot,&#x201D; have been disastrous. In providing evidence, legal
          scholars, lawyers, and judges often cite Web pages in their footnotes; they expect that
          evidence to remain where they found it as their proof, the way that evidence on
          paper&#x2014;in court records and books and law journals&#x2014;remains where they found
          it, in libraries and courthouses. But a 2013 survey of law- and policy-related
          publications found that, at the end of six years, nearly fifty per cent of the URLs cited
          in those publications no longer worked. According to a 2014 study conducted at Harvard Law
          School, &#x201C;more than 70% of the URLs within the Harvard Law Review and other
          journals, and 50% of the URLs within United States Supreme Court opinions, do not link to
          the originally cited information.&#x201D;

          The overwriting, drifting, and rotting of the Web is no less catastrophic for engineers,
          scientists, and doctors. Last month, a team of digital library researchers based at Los
          Alamos National Laboratory reported the results of an exacting study of three and a half
          million scholarly articles published in science, technology, and medical journals between
          1997 and 2012: one in five links provided in the notes suffers from reference rot.
          It&#x2019;s like trying to stand on quicksand.

        <p><b>Photos from your friend&apos;s party are not part of the common record.</b></p>

        <p>
          Nor are most casual conversations. Nor are search histories, commercial transactions,
          &quot;friend networks&quot;, or most things that might be labeled &quot;personal
          data&quot;. These are not deliberate publications like a bound book; they are not intended
          to be lasting contributions to the public discourse.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fact that they <i>can</i> persist -- that the medium is constructed such that this
          data accidentally travels further and lasts longer than anyone intended, and that this
          data is easily retained and exploited by intermediaries -- is an enormous and terrifying
          problem of its own.

        <p>
          I&apos;ve come to believe that a lot of what&apos;s wrong with the Internet has to do with
          memory. The Internet somehow contrives to remember too much and too little at the same
          time, and it maps poorly on our concepts of how memory should work.

          In our elementary schools in America, if we did something particularly heinous, they had a
          special way of threatening you. They would say: &quot;This is going on your permanent
          record&quot;.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was pretty scary. I had never seen a permanent record, but I knew exactly what it must
          look like. It was bright red, thick, tied with twine. Full of official stamps.
        </p>

        <p>
          The permanent record would follow you through life, and whenever you changed schools, or
          looked for a job or moved to a new house, people would see the shameful things you had
          done in fifth grade.
        </p>

        <p>
          How wonderful it felt when I first realized the permanent record didn&apos;t exist. They
          were bluffing! Nothing I did was going to matter! We were free!
        </p>

        <p>And then when I grew up, I helped build it for real.</p>

        <p>* * *</p>

        <p>
          It doesn&apos;t make sense to make blanket statements like &quot;content on the web should
          be persistent&quot; or &quot;content on the web should be ephemeral&quot;. Instead, we
          need to recognize that this &quot;web&quot; thing is conflating two very different forms
          of discourse, forms that used to be clearly and deliberately distinct.
        </p>

        <p>
          The &quot;web&quot; is not a part of nature. It was not discovered; we don&apos;t have to
          just accept it. The &quot;web&quot; is an infrastructural system that was built by people,
          and it was built very recently and very sloppily. It currently has the property that it
          forgets what must be remembered, and remembers what must be forgotten. It manages to screw
          up both the sacredness of the common record and the sacredness of private interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          For people who have grown up with HTTP and URLs, it can be hard to see anything wrong with
          them. The tendency is to blame individual behavior -- &quot;You should have mirrored that
          data!&quot; &quot;You shouldn&apos;t have put those photos online!&quot; But the technical
          properties of a medium shape social practice, and if the resulting social practice is
          harmful, it&apos;s the medium that is at fault.
        </p>

        <p>* * *</p>

        <p>
          If your goal is to fix this broken medium, please consider that, historically, people have
          relied on <i>different media for different social purposes</i>, and have relied on a
          <i>clear understanding</i> of how the technical properties of each medium determine the
          social and temporal scope of its messages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think about speech, letters, newspapers, books, smoke signals... Each medium serves only a
          particular subset of social purposes, and each medium is technically transparent enough
          that people can understand what&apos;s happening when they use it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The web is a single, increasingly complex infrastructure which has been adopted for
          mutually incompatible purposes. And almost nobody has a clear understanding of what the
          hell is actually happening when they type into a box on their screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are currently well-meaning forces at work to improve the web for some particular
          purpose, and they generally have the effect of making the overall system more complex,
          less transparent, and more hostile to other purposes. For example, people who see the web
          as a publication medium have proposed persistent, content-addressed schemes such as
          <a href="http://ipfs.io/" style="color: #2b6cb0; text-decoration: underline;">IPFS</a>,
          with (as far as I can see) little provision for the necessary ephemerality of personal and
          conversational data. And people who see the web as a conversational medium or application
          platform have proposed policies such as
          <a
            href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/"
            style="color: #2b6cb0; text-decoration: underline;"
            >mandatory encryption</a
          >, which could have detrimental effects on a stable and accessible long-term common
          record.
        </p>

        <p>
          It might be that the notion of &quot;the&quot; web -- in the sense of a single complex
          protocol supporting all human communicative purposes -- isn&apos;t a very good idea.
